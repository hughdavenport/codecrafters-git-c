This is a repository for my solutions to the
["Build Your Own Git" Challenge](https://codecrafters.io/challenges/git) in C. You can see my progress above.
You can also watch a [YouTube series TBD](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=TBD) where I discuss and code the solutions.

In this challenge, you'll build a small Git implementation that's capable of
initializing a repository, creating commits and cloning a public repository.
Along the way we'll learn about the `.git` directory, Git objects (blobs,
commits, trees etc.), Git's transfer protocols and more.

**Note**: If you're viewing this repo on GitHub, head over to
[codecrafters.io](https://codecrafters.io) to try the challenge.

# Running the program

The entry point for your git implementation is in `app/main.c`, but you can compile and run it with `your_program.sh`, or `.codecrafters/debug.sh` if you want to go step by step.
